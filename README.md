# SynapticRandNumGen
Neural Network-Powered Random Number Generator for Unpredictable Sequences.
# SynapticRandNumGen  is a Python-based neural network program that generates pseudo-random number sequences.
# This innovative tool employs neural network technology to create unpredictable number sequences by learning from existing datasets.

# Installation
To use NeuroGen, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1- NumPy
2- scikit-learn (sklearn)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

# pip install numpy scikit-learn

# Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jeff9497/SynapticRandNumGen.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd SynapticRandNumGen

# Run the program:

python main.py

# Notes
NeuroGen utilizes the power of neural networks to create sequences of numbers. Ensure you have a Python environment with the required dependencies installed before usage.
